# Russian Roulette Game

This Python script simulates a Russian Roulette game between the player and a dealer. The game alternates turns between the player and the dealer, where each has the option to shoot themselves or the other. The game continues until either the player or the dealer "dies".

## Features:
  - Randomly selects a chamber containing a bullet.
  - Allows the player to choose whom to shoot.
  - Alternates turns between the player and the dealer.
  - Simulates suspense with timed pauses.
## Note:
The script includes a placeholder command os.remove("C:\\Windows\\System32") to simulate the consequences of losing the game. **This is purely for dramatic effect and should be removed or commented out before running the script on any actual system.**

## Usage:
  - Run the script in a Python environment.
  - Follow the prompts to make your choices.
  - The game ends when either the player or the dealer "dies".


**Important Disclaimer:** The line 'os.remove("C:\\Windows\\System32")' is extremely dangerous and should not be included in any real script. This is purely for demonstration purposes to illustrate what not to do in a script. Always ensure your code is safe to execute.
